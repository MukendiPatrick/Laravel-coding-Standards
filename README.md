# Laravel-coding-Standards
Laravel coding Standards with PHP Code Sniffer (phpcs).

PHP CodeSniffer is a utility composed of two PHP scripts; the main phpcs script that tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding standard and a second phpcbf script to automatically fix the basic coding standard problems.

We use composer as a wrapper to manage the CodeSniffer version, dependencies, and execution.
